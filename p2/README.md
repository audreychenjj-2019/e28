## Outside resources
To get a question bank I use the open API data here.
<https://opentdb.com/api_config.php>

To make the JSON file readable, I used this website to see the structure of the JSON array.
<http://json2table.com/>

To shuffle the answer array in my quiz I read **List Move Transitions** on this page.
<https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/transitions.html#List-Move-Transitions>

## Notes for instructor
I got a work-around solution for the decoding challenge I used to have.
